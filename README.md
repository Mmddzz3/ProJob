-  I have build a web scraper that fetches Software Developer job listings from the [*Monster*](https://www.monster.com/jobs/search/?q=Software-Developer) job aggregator site.
-  My web scraper parses the HTML to pick out the relevant pieces of information and filter that content for specific words.
